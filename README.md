## Commit messages

Note: the git history prior to [6d2454f](https://github.com/vinckr/vinckr.com/commit/6d2454f827bbffddc43dc0a6814de5064cbdcedd) is a mess so feel free to ignore that! I'm striving to keep the history clean using [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) going forward, but since I am the only one contributing to this I am not always motivated to so.

`fix`: a commit of the type fix patches a bug

`feat`: a commit of the type feat introduces a new feature

`docs`: changes to the README and other meta docs

`chore`: fixing small errors in articles, typos, archiving drafts, and similar (uninteresting) chores

not part of conventional commits and specific to this site:

`weblog`: new entry to the monthly weblog

`article`: new article

`edit`: any edits to existing artices, weblogs, lists or other text
