This is my website. There are many like it, but this one is mine.
My website is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life.
Without me, my website is useless. Without my website, I am useless. 
I must code my website true. I must code straighter than my enemy who is trying to hack me. 
I must be smart or else he hacks me.. We will be smarter ...
My website and I know that what counts in the internet is not the bugs we squash, the bikes we shed, nor the yaks we shave.  
We know that it is the hits that count. We will count hits ...
My website is human, even as I am human, because it is my life. Thus, I will learn it as a brother. 
I will learn its weaknesses, its strength, its parts, its accessories, its source and its components. 
I will keep my website clean and ready, even as I am clean and ready. We will become part of each other. We will ...
Before God, I swear this creed. 
My website and I are the defenders of my intenet. 
We are the masters of our enemy. 
We are the saviors of our culture.
So be it, until the web is free and wild and there is no enemy, but peace!
