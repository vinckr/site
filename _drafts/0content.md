### Quotes


Don't ignore your dreams, but also critically examine your dreams to ensure they're healthy and would actually bring you happiness
It is not possible to step twice into the same river according to Heraclitus, or to come into contact twice with a mortal being in the same state. (Plutarch)

That day, beginning with the fissure opening on the frontier, the shape of the world began to crumble.
Change gives the illusion of progress
they love you then they hate you thats the curse


¯\_(ツ)\_/¯

Few people are capable of expressing with equanimity opinions which differ from the prejudices of their social environment. Most people are even incapable of forming such opinions.

Der uns gewohnte Ordnungsrahmen steht stark unter Druck.

"Hinter jedem Menschen, der jetzt lebt, stehen dreißig Geister, denn das ist das Verhältnis, in dem die Toten gegen die Lebenden in der Überzahl sind. Seit dem Anbruch der Zeit sind auf dem Planeten Erde rund hundert Milliarden Menschen gewandelt."

The Aneristic Principle is that of apparent order; the Eristic Principle is that of apparent disorder. Both order and disorder are man made concepts and are artificial divisions of pure chaos, which is a level deeper than is the level of distinction making.
With our concept-making apparatus called "the brain" we look at reality through the ideas-about-reality which our cultures give us. The ideas-about-reality are mistakenly labeled "reality" and unenlightened people are forever perplexed by the fact that other people, especially other cultures, see "reality" differently.
It is only the ideas-about-reality which differ. Real (capital-T) True reality is a level deeper than is the level of concept. We look at the world through windows on which have been drawn grids (concepts). Different philosophies use different grids. A culture is a group of people with rather similar grids. Through a window we view chaos, and relate it to the points on our grid, and thereby understand it. The order is in the grid. That is the Aneristic Principle.
Western philosophy is traditionally concerned with contrasting one grid with another grid, and amending grids in hopes of finding a perfect one that will account for all reality and will, hence, (say unenlightened westerners) be true. This is illusory; it is what we Erisians call the Aneristic Illusion. Some grids can be more useful than others, some more beautiful than others, some more pleasant than others, etc., but none can be more True than any other.
Disorder is simply unrelated information viewed through some particular grid. But, like "relation", no-relation is a concept. Male, like female, is an idea about sex. To say that male-ness is "absence of female-ness", or vice versa, is a matter of definition and metaphysically arbitrary. The artificial concept of no-relation is the Eristic Principle.
The belief that "order is true" and disorder is false or somehow wrong, is the Aneristic Illusion. To say the same of disorder, is the Eristic Illusion. The point is that (little-t) truth is a matter of definition relative to the grid one is using at the moment, and that (capital-T) Truth, metaphysical reality, is irrelevant to grids entirely. Pick a grid, and through it some chaos appears ordered and some appears disordered. Pick another grid, and the same chaos will appear differently ordered and disordered.Reality is the original Rorschach. Verily! So much for all that.

May 8, 2021
The animal is aging. Not surprising; I knew it would happen eventually, but I didn't make any provisions to deal with that eventuality. Somehow the reality crept up on me. And now it must be dealt with, day after day.
It is restless in the night, moaning about aches, unable to find a comfortable position for sleep. It awakes me too early, muscles stiff and reluctant to move but unable to return to sleep. And if I let it sit still, it dozes off in the middle of the day. Finding foods it can eat without upsetting its digestion has become a task as it rejects more and more foods but balks at the monotonous diet it can manage. And despite restricting its food, it is putting on pounds, its middle thickening as the creature loses strength, loses flexibility.  
When it was young, I drove it hard. I fed it whatever was to hand, or didn't feed it at all. It slept only when I no longer needed its labor at the end of a long day. Day after day of steady work, night sleep sacrificed for more work; It didn't seem to mind. It could run, it could climb, it could carry heavy loads. It was never the loveliest of its kind, but it had endurance and strength beyond what some others possessed. It still does, but it pays more dearly when what I demand exceeds what I should expect of it. It never had fast reflexes, and now it's even slower to react.  
The animal remembers every harsh thing I've done to it. I kept it too long in the cold, frostbiting its feet, and now every cold floor reminds it of what I did. I have degenerated its joints to keep to a schedule. Now its grip is fading. I risked its eyesight by staring endlessly at a screen, and now the colors are fading out of its day.
As our time together is winding slowy to a close, I wish I'd taken better care of it. Better food, more exercise, more relaxation . . . but I also wonder if it would have made any difference. I tell myself it still has useful years ahead of it, even if it can't do some of the things it once accomplished with ease. I reflect, sheepishly, that it is the only animal I have ever treated this way. Would I have fed a beloved dog stimulants to keep it working when it needed sleep? Never. Would I have dosed a cat with a mild poisoning of alcohol to relax it among strangers? Of course not.
But this one animal received no mercy from me. And I regret that now.
And so we enter our 70th year together. Me, and the animal I live inside.
Be kind to animals. It's never too late to start.

Stood in firelight, sweltering. Bloodstain on chest like map of violent new continent. Felt cleansed. Felt dark planet turn under my feet and knew what cats know that makes them scream like babies in night.

Looked at sky through smoke heavy with human fat and God was not there. The cold, suffocating dark goes on forever and we are alone. Live our lives, lacking anything better to do. Devise reason later. Born from oblivion; bear children, hell-bound as ourselves, go into oblivion. There is nothing else.
Existence is random. Has no pattern save what we imagine after staring at it for too long. No meaning save what we choose to impose. This rudderless world is not shaped by vague metaphysical forces. It is not God who kills the children. Not fate that butchers them or destiny that feeds them to the dogs. It’s us. Only us. Streets stank of fire. The void breathed hard on my heart, turning its illusions to ice, shattering them. Was reborn then, free to scrawl my own design on this morally blank world.

People should either be caressed or crushed. If you do them minor damage they will get their revenge.

It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better.

The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.

No right was deemed by the fathers of the Government more sacred than the right of speech. It was in their eyes, as in the eyes of all thoughtful men, the great moral renovator of society and government. Daniel Webster called it a homebred right, a fireside privilege. Liberty is meaningless where the right to utter one’s thoughts and opinions has ceased to exist. That, of all rights, is the dread of tyrants. It is the right which they first of all strike down. They know its power. Thrones, dominions, principalities, and powers, founded in injustice and wrong, are sure to tremble, if men are allowed to reason of righteousness, temperance, and of a judgment to come in their presence
The principle must rest upon its own proper basis. And until the right is accorded to the humblest as freely as to the most exalted citizen, the government of Boston is but an empty name, and its freedom a mockery. A man's right to speak does not depend upon where he was born or upon his color. The simple quality of manhood is the solid basis of the right—and there let it rest forever.

Now that we've seen the simulations, we can go back to Painless Software Schedules to emphasize one of the points Joel makes a big deal about: you can't negotiate about how fast people will work. Engineers work at different rates at different times, but it really isn't very variable. Remember those surprisingly straight downward slopes in the simulations? It's just as surprising in real life projects - I'll get to that in a bit. But that straight line makes a clear statement: that yes, I really can extrapolate to predict how long it will take to finish a particular set of tasks, and no, I really cannot do it faster and I probably will not do it slower, either. End of story, conversation over.
Once we know that - and burndown charts are quite good at convincing people that it's true - then we can have the real conversation, which is, what things actually need to go into the release and which things don't? Once we know the work rate - the slope of that line - we can move the requirements around to hit whatever date we want. We want to do this as early as possible of course, because late requirements changes are expensive, as we saw in the simulator. But since we do know the work rate, we can predict the completion date immediately, which means it's possible to have those discussions really early, rather than as we approach the deadline.
Suddenly, the manager and the engineers are on equal footing. The manager is a trained negotiator and can fire you, but the engineers have empirical truth on their side: this is not a matter of opinion, and the facts are not going to change. Better still, the engineers mostly don't care too much what order they do the features in (within reason). So the manager or PM, who is now making the scheduling decisions, doesn't need to negotiate with engineers. They can negotiate with sales or marketing or bizdev teams or whoever, who have actual feature requirements and date requirements, and agree on a combination of features and dates that is physically possible in the real world.
And then, crucially, they will not tell those dates to the engineering team. The engineering team doesn't need to know. That would be setting a goal, and goals are bad. The engineers just do the work in priority order, and don't multitask too much, and let statistics handle things. No student syndrome, no Whatever Conference rush, no working weekends, no burnout, and no lazy days needed to recover from burnout.

1. Create a One-Liner that tells the primary reason your offering needs to exist and be adopted by your customer.
2. Associate each Feature with a Benefit, all pointing back to the One-Liner.
3. Create a Landing Page that proves 1 and 2.

After two years of doc writing at amazon, probably Over 1000 pages of content at this point-
Early in the morning, when mind is fresh, not after full day of meetings
Block off 2-3 hours
Caffeine, empty stomach-
Start with first draft and just brain dump. Don’t worry about details.. leave lots of <<fill this in later>>
Start in a notebook with pen and paper only, physically remove yourself from phone and computer, sketch your thoughts on paper and then go to computer to brain dump
Don’t aim for any amount.. no doc is too little
Don’t format, proof read, correct too much at the beginning
Little wine/beer/whiskey can help (but you probably don’t want to do this early in the morning
Long Hot shower can help you gather your thoughts
Take a break when your brain is fried, walk around, come back to it fresh
