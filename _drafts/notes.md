notes

- dont live by a system
- we are not immortal, death is a function of life.
  we need to account for it and be mindful of its reality.
  it is not something to be feared or praised
  with all the strive and needless violence that pervades our lives now.
  a deathless society would be truly monstrous
  i would be poor if i die a rich man.
