# hello stranger &#128075;

Welcome to my personal website. There are many like it but this one is mine.  
It is my virtual garden, testlab, and archive. I am interested in philosophy, open source software, music,
literature, liminal spaces and communities.

Would you like your own personal website or need help with building a community
or open source project? Feel free to [write me](mailto:mail@vinckr.com).
Everyone should have a personal space online, furthering creativity and diversity.

I believe in the power and merit of an open and free internet and try to advance this cause where I can.
