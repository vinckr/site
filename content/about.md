Hi, I'm Vincent.  
I'm currently working as **Developer Advocate at Ory**, where I lead our Developer Relations and Documentation teams. In my daily work I focus on educating and growing the Ory developer community.

Welcome to my personal website. There are many like it but this one is mine. It is my virtual garden, testlab, and archive.

I am passionate about a broad number of topics including music, literature, liminal spaces, FOSS, and just the general craziness that is the interwebs. It was this diversity of interests that led me to my current mission of building communities for developers.

Outside of Ory I assist early-stage startups with developer relations programs to help them establish their program from the ground up, or provide guidance on community expansion, content production, and developer outreach.
I believe in the power and merit of an open and free internet and try to advance this cause where I can.

See you out there ðŸ‘‹
