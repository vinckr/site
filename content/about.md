Hello there! My name is Vincent.  
I am in charge of **Developer Relations** at **Ory**. In my work I focus on educating and growing the Ory developer community.

Welcome to my personal website. A lot are like it but this one is mine. It's my virtual garden, testlab, and archive.

I am passionate about a broad number of topics including music, literature, liminal spaces, FOSS, and just the general craziness that's the interwebs. This diversity of interests led me to my current mission of building communities for developers.

Outside of Ory I assist startups with developer relations programs to help them establish their program from the ground up, or provide guidance on community expansion, content production, and developer outreach.
I believe in the power and merit of an open and free internet and try to advance this cause where I can.

See you out there ðŸ‘‹
