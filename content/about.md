Hello there! My name is Vincent.  
I am in charge of **Developer Relations** at **Ory**.  
In my work I focus on educating, stewarding, and growing the Ory developer community.

Welcome to my personal website. A lot are like it but this one is mine. It's my virtual garden, testlab, and archive.

I am passionate about a broad number of topics including music, literature, liminal spaces, FOSS, and just the general craziness that's the interwebs.

Need assistance with buiding an effective developer relations programs from the ground up, or guidance on community expansion, developer marketing, and outreach? [Contact me!](mail@vinckr.com)

I believe in the power and merit of an open and free internet and try to advance this cause wherever possible.
