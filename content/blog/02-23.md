title: Log February 2023
---

Hello friend.  
The log is a collection of links I come across in a given month and thought would be worth for you to check out.
What a strange and wonderful month it has been. I don't have anything interesting to say, just that I am looking forward to what is coming next and maybe I can get my ass up and finish some of the other content I have lying around half-done.

Anway, enjoy this months link digest and I hope we'll see each other again next month!

PS: I also want to change the style and layout of the website a bit and maybe even move to a different static page builder. We will see how that went in the next one - sometimes helps to put a bit of pressure on myself in this way.
