### Olden-tyme pancakes

#### Ingredients

- Sweet cream 3/4 + pint.
- Flour a quarter of a pound.
- Four Eggs, leave out two of the whites.
- Sweet butter half a pound.
- Half a grated nutmeg & litle orangeflower water.

#### Steps

1. Beat the eggs very well.
1. Then put in the flour, beat it a quarter of a hour.
1. Then put in six spoonfulls of the cream, beat it a litle.
1. Melt the butter, mix in all the rest by degrees beating it all the time.
1. Then put in the rest of the cream & beat it well.

1. This is the right way.

### Bread Dumplings (Semmelknödel)

#### Ingredients

- 0.5 kg old bread (Semmeln)
- 2 eggs
- 0.5 l milk
- 1 onion
- 1 Bund Petersilie
- Nutmeg
- Salt
- Pepper
- Flour for forming the Knödel

#### Steps

1. Cut the bread into small cubes, place them in a bowl and mix with 1 teaspoon of salt.
1. Finely dice the onions and sauté briefly in butter with the finely chopped parsley. Heat the milk but do not bring to the boil.
1. Add the onion and parsley mixture and the warm milk to the bread cubes in the bowl. Mix everything together and leave to stand for 10 minutes.
1. Now prepare a large pot with plenty of salted water.
1. Whisk the eggs and add them to the mixture, along with a little more salt and pepper.
1. Then knead vigorously, preferably with your hands, to form a malleable mass. If the dumpling dough is too soft, you can fold in some breadcrumbs. If it is too dry, add a little milk.
1. With wet hands (with or without disposable kitchen gloves), form approx. 8 tennis ball-sized dumplings.
1. Place the dumplings in the boiling salted water and immediately turn the heat to medium. The dumplings must not be boiled - or they will fall apart - but left to poach.

### Gratin

#### Ingredients

- Butter (for greasing the dish)
- Garlic
- Potatoes
- Herb salt
- Freshly grated nutmeg
- Cream
- Milk
- Vegetable broth
- Pepper

#### Steps

1. Grease a flat gratin dish with butter.
1. Peel the garlic. Either finely chop it and distribute it in the dish or press it directly into the dish.
1. Peel the potatoes and slice them thinly (A cucumber slicer goes fast).
1. Layer half of the potato slices in the dish.
1. Season lightly with herbs, salt and freshly grated nutmeg, then layer the remaining potatoes on top.
1. Mix cream and milk - just mik is also fine if you dont have cream at hand.
1. Season strongly with vegetable broth powder, herb salt, nutmeg, and pepper.
1. Pour this mixture over the potatoes.
1. Sprinkle butter flakes on top of the gratin.
1. Bake in the preheated oven at 180°C (356°F) for about 1 hour.
1. Serve hot.

### Sandwich

Arguably the best kind of food.

#### The classic

1. Bread
1. Any kind of cheese or ham, works best sliced
1. Mustard - I prefer medium hot mustard
1. If you are feeling fancy, add a pickle.
