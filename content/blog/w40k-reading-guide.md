## Part 0: 40K

- [x] Storm of Iron - Complete Honsou Omnibus
- [x] Warriors of Ultramar - Uriel Ventris Chronicles Omnibus 1

## Part 1: The Fall of Horus

- [x] The Wolf of Ash and Fire - Eye of Terra (35) by Graham McNeill
  - I screwed up here and read the whole collection of short stories. This first story though is something different, we see the Emperor in action cutting up Orks. Overall a nice collection of stories, some I already spoilered for later in this list woops.
- [x] Horus Rising (1) by Dan Abnett
  - ends with reaching Davin. Here Horus is portrayed as the ultimate leader - kind, understanding, firm. Sure a warmaster, but also the best version of one that you could imagine. Murder (the planet) is also fun with lots of epic battle. The first half was great, the second a bit tedious.
- [x] False Gods (2) by Graham McNeill
  - This one took a while to get going but as soon as they land on Davin's moon, Nurgle makes his first appearance and I loved that part. The part where Horus gets corrupted was a bit weak for me - to me it was not really realistic that the character was so "easily convinced" to join Chaos. A good read overall.
- [x] Galaxy in Flames (3) by Ben Counter
  - Lots of battle on Istvan III, the rebellion is in full swing now. I liked Tarvitz as character, but the endless slaughter can get a bit tedious at times. So far the hardest to get through.
- [x] Flight of the Eisenstein (4) by James Swallow
  - best one in the series so far! Garro is a great protagonist, lots of fun battle and Nurgle action. Overall very entertaining read.
- [x] Fulgrim (5) by Graham McNeil
  - Even though its optional I would recommend to read it. The constant talk about becoming perfect is a bit annoying but the book is a entertaining tale of sinking into more and more depravity. I already spoiled the outcome for me a bit when I read one of the Eye of Terra shortstories on Fulgrim, but I liked that it was not only guns and carnage this time, but a more refined mix of topics.

## Part 2: The First Heretic

- [x] The Last Church - Tales of Heresy (10) by Graham McNeill
  - short story that sees the Emperor as philosopher musing about religion as he is finishing his conquest of Terra, lots of spooky foreshadowing included.
- [x] The First Heretic (14) by Aaron Dembski-Bowden
  - I really liked this one. I would say it was maybe the best of the series so far - not only mandatory reading due to the important turning point in Lorgars journey towards Chaos, but the even aside of the lore the story and other characters are also great. I especially like Argel Tal, very much looking forward to what happens to him.
- [x] The Aurelian - Eye of Terra (35) by Aaron Dembski-Bowden
  - short story where we hear the tale of Lorgars own travel into the empyrean. It sheds a bit more light on how he fully turns to Chaos, but I mostly liked the battle against Khornes avatar. Lorgar is becoming a little bit less pathetic here.
- [x] Know No Fear (19) by Dan Abnett
  - epic large scale warfare, really entertaining read, a bit confusing in the beginning but I enjoyed both sides of this conflict. So far the loyalists were pretty lame, but they had some real badass moments in this one. I especially liked the perpetual trooper, hopefully he shows up again later on! Also the newbie dreadnought was a great character.

## Part 3: Betrayer

- [x] After Deshea - Tales of Heresy (10) by Matt Farrer
  - The XII legion does not have it easy. Nice short story introducing Angron. The more he features as an actual character and not just some bloodthirsty butcher the more I like him!
- [ ] Lord of the Red Sands - War Without End (33) by Aaron Dembski-Bowden - skipped for now
- [ ] Butcher's Nails - Legacies of Betrayal (31) by Aaron Dembski-Bowden - skipped for now
- [x] Betrayer (24) by Aaron Dembski-Bowden
  - describes the ascencion of the World Eaters through bloody massacres to become the bloody skull collectors we know and love. Angron is a particularly interesting primarchs, flawed and despicable but still a lot to like.

## Part 4: The Lion and The Prince

- [x] Shadows of Treachery (22) - The Dark King by Graham McNeill
  - I don't have much to say here, its a short story on Cruze's downfall. He probably already was on his way out to Chaos corruption without even Lorgar or Horus playing a role. Nevertheless one of the coolest primarchs.
- [x] Massacre - Eye of Terra (35) by Aaron Dembski-Bowden
  - similar, a short story on Nightlords during the Isstvan dropsite massacre.
- [x] Fallen Angels (11) by Mike Lee
- [x] Savage Weapons - Age of Darkness (16) by Aaron Dembski-Bowden
- [x] The Lion - The Primarchs (20) by Gav Thorpe
- [x] Prince of Crows - Shadows of Treachery (22) by Aaron Dembski-Bowden
- [x] Master of the First - Eye of Terra (35) by Gav Thorpe
- [x] The Long Night - Eye of Terra (35) by Aaron Dembski-Bowden
  - too lazy to write a review for each of these short stories, but I have to say I really warmed up to the Night Lords. Their primarch is pathetic and they are mostly traitors and turncloaks - but I like their savage pride and calculating nature. Especially Sevatar is a great character, rotten, cruel and brutal to the bone - but he still has a "good" side to him. In any case reading about Sevatar decapitating people with his chainglave is just very entertaining and for now the Night Lords are my favourites from these books.
- [x] Lord of the Night by Simon Spurrier - I can recommend this one, very different setting from all other books I read before. Really liked the ending as well.
- [x] Night Lords Omnibus by Aaron Dembski-Bowden - this was a long one, took me a couple of months to get through. But highly entertaining I don't want to spoil anything but ADB can bring out the best in the Night Lords very convincingly. Truly the best read for those that want to get more into the Night Lords and all the thick lore around them. Also the Night Lords have a very unique view on the Great Betrayal and for all their savagery and evil they - or at least some of them - come across as the most sane of the fallen Legions.

## Part 5: Imperium Secondus

- [x] The Unremembered Empire (27) by Dan Abnett - flew through this one, a quick and easy read. If you want to see a lot of primarch and perpetual action and also a bit of backstory on a number of key characters I would recommend it.
