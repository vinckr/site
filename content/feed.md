- [What If Data Is a Bad Idea?](https://schmud.de/posts/2024-08-18-data-is-a-bad-idea.html) - In my experience it very often is a bad idea, since the data is bad and people don't take the time to get it into a state that actually tells you something concrete - most often that is also very hard to do, if not impossible.

Great [HN comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41322474) on that article:

> I spend a huge chunk of my time swimming in a sea of data that people have carelessly amassed on the assumption that data is inherently valuable. And frequently I come to the conclusion that this data has negative value. The people who collected it failed to record enough information about the data's provenance. So I don't know what kind of processes produced it, how and why it was collected, any transformations that might have happened on the way to storing it, etc. Without that information, I simply cannot know for sure what any of it really means with enough precision to be able to draw valid conclusions from it. The best I can do is advise caution, say that this data can help us form hypotheses whose only true use is helping us form a plan to collect new data that will help us answer the question we have. What I'm typically asked to do instead is make a best guess and call it good. The former option is just the scientific method. The latter option is the very essence of pseudoscience. That second word in my job title gives me some anxiety. I'm keenly aware that most people are more fond of the word "science" than they are of the intellectual practice we call science. The people who like to amass data are no exception.

Quote from [Francis Ford Coppola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Ford_Coppola) on death:

> I have no fear of death whatsoever. I used to do a little experiment for the fun of it in my elevator here, when I go down to the first floor. I can control the elevator so when I go in, I shut out the lights and I’m in total darkness. I think, when I get to the first floor that I’m going to be dead. As I go down, I think, I had such an interesting life, I got to be a movie director, have a wife and children, had so much fun with them, got to be in the wine business, go through everything, and as I’m lost in all these interesting thoughts, the door opens on the first floor and I’m not dead. I walk out.

**The Ten Commandments of Guitar Playing**

1. **Listen to the birds.** -
   That's where all the music comes from. Birds know everything about how it should sound and where that sound should come from. And watch hummingbirds. They fly really fast, but a lot of times they aren't going anywhere.

2. **Your guitar is not really a guitar, your guitar is a divining rod.** -
   Use it to find spirits in the other world and bring them over. A guitar is also a fishing rod. If you're good, you'll land a big one.

3. **Practice in front of a bush** -
   Wait until the moon is out, then go outside, eat a multi-grained bread and play your guitar to a bush. If the bush dosen't shake, eat another piece of bread.

4. **Walk with the devil** -
   Old Delta blues players referred to guitar amplifiers as the "devil box." And they were right. You have to be an equal opportunity employer in terms of who you're bringing over from the other side. Electricity attracts devils and demons. Other instruments attract other spirits. An acoustic guitar attracts Casper. A mandolin attracts Wendy. But an electric guitar attracts Beelzebub.

5. **If you're guilty of thinking, you're out** -
   If your brain is part of the process, you're missing it. You should play like a drowning man, struggling to reach shore. If you can trap that feeling, then you have something that is fur bearing.

6. **Never point your guitar at anyone** -
   Your instrument has more clout than lightning. Just hit a big chord then run outside to hear it. But make sure you are not standing in an open field.

7. **Always carry a church key** -
   That's your key-man clause. Like One String Sam. He's one. He was a Detroit street musician who played in the fifties on a homemade instrument. His song "I Need a Hundred Dollars" is warm pie. Another key to the church is Hubert Sumlin, Howlin' Wolf's guitar player. He just stands there like the Statue of Liberty-making you want to look up her dress the whole time to see how he's doing it.

8. **Don't wipe the sweat off your instrument** -
   You need that stink on there. Then you have to get that stink onto your music.

9. **Keep your guitar in a dark place** -
   When you're not playing your guitar, cover it and keep it in a dark place. If you don't play your guitar for more than a day, be sure you put a saucer of water in with it.

10. **You gotta have a hood for your engine** -
    Keep that hat on. A hat is a pressure cooker. If you have a roof on your house, the hot air can't escape. Even a lima bean has to have a piece of wet paper around it to make it grow.

> Man is a gregarious animal. We work in herds, in teams. The bear can do exactly as he pleases, for he works alone. We do not work alone. We depend throughout our lives on the goodwill of other men. If a man does not learn to bend, to be friendly and considerate, and to respect his brother’s ego — in things both big and little — he’ll find himself disliked and locked up in his own unhappiness." — C.F. Braun

_how to market a product_

1. Create a one-liner that tells the primary reason your product needs to exist and should be used by your customers.
2. Associate each feature with a benefit, all pointing back to the one-liner.
3. Create a landing page website that proves 1 and 2.

plundered from HN comment

> The more i've studied i've come to the opposite conclusion. Nature is >99% magic and though some tiny slices of human friendly interfaces of reality are replicable much more is chaos, weird emergence, fields, probabilities and stuff so bizarre to our mammalian logic that we might as well call it magic, god, the simulation or just bleeding edge physics as the whole field is getting weirder and weirder. The whole notion of natures beauty stemming from some replicable, controllable and "no magic" scenario is a very "homo sapiens" desire for order and control. We know close to nothing, and therein lies the beauty in my eyes.

> All things, Apethitikes says, are born from bitterness. It is in their nature to be hostile. At the beginning of time, there was only an infinitely small spark, which flared into being because of its hatred of the void. Once it had sparked, it had nothing to hate but itself; recoiling away from its own being, it broke into millions of mutually loathing atoms, which is why there are distinct objects today. Time exists because each instant hates each other instant and insists on being separated from it. The Sun smears itself across the sky because it hates every position it occupies, and light bursts out from its surface in explosive horror. The Moon has its phases because it hates both darkness and light. Rains fall because they hate the heavens. Plants grow upwards because they hate the earth. Everything is constantly in tension and contradiction, and this poisonous churn is what we call life. A world without hatred would be sterile, motionless, and empty. Insipid oneness. A placid speck. Apethitikes of Ephesus loved hatred, and he loved the world hatred had built. To sit peacefully in the afternoon and watch the birds wheeling above the bright blue sea. This million-petalled flower; this treasury of things.

> God brought humanity into a life of suffering solely to punish us for being lesser than him, and that all souls eventually make their way to Hell

> God may again allow some mote of his goodness to fall upon this wicked world, so by the contrast we might better see it for the filthy sewer it is?

> Sometimes, he writes, ‘a terrible thought arises: that God did not build this world to punish us, nor as a gift for us, but that he has a purpose for this great contraption that is entirely his own, and pays us no mind at all.’

Ist es denn Unrecht, wenn ich für euch erglühte?  
Und Schmach, wenn ich in Eures Leibes Pracht,  
Die Samt und Seide neidisch überdacht,

Verstattet diesem hitzigen Geblüte,  
Daß es an Euer Liebespförtchen poch!  
Dann seufzt ihr wohl:

Nur einmal noch!"

> the bardo the two peasants had found themselves in was the sidpa bardo, the bardo of becoming, the one we experience after death. Sidpa bardo is tahe interzone between one life and the next, the junkyard of earthly existence, packed with the detritus and runoff of worlds. This is where gods and buddhas take on their fearsome forms, and to pass through sidpa bardo involves suffering many frightening visions. Because this bardo state is made of unstructured waste-thought leaking out from all other bardos, it is always flickering, impermanent. You will see a world you do not understand, and you will see it in ruins. Every city you pass through is bombed. Every person you meet falls dead in battle. You will be attacked by demons and wild animals. But sidpa bardo is educative; the point of these visions is to prepare you for being born again. The entire Second World War had been fought solely to teach these two Tibetan peasants some secret for their next life. They believed they had learned that secret. They had no interest in returning to Gyêgumdo. They did not want the war to have been in vain.

[...] if we concede to war at least some measure of the automony enjoyed by living things, then we must acknowledge that we have invested these lofty passions in a peculiar kind of god indeed - an entity that is ultimately alien to us and supremely indifferent to our fate. We have sacrificed our loved ones for what is worse than nothing: we have sacrificed them for something that has no use to us.

God whose one eye is the Moon and the other, the Sun. Vision blending somewhere at the back of the skull. The moon eye saw in grainy black and white, the sun eye in color, with clarity. The moon eye was at home in a netherworld where only the shadow of the ordinary fell. The sun eye followed every line and angle, every contour, was fascinated by shape’s lovely demise—a melting candle, say.
