_how to market a product_

1. Create a one-liner that tells the primary reason your product needs to exist and should be used by your customers.
2. Associate each feature with a benefit, all pointing back to the one-liner.
3. Create a landing page website that proves 1 and 2.

plundered from HN comment

> The more i've studied i've come to the opposite conclusion. Nature is >99% magic and though some tiny slices of human friendly interfaces of reality are replicable much more is chaos, weird emergence, fields, probabilities and stuff so bizarre to our mammalian logic that we might as well call it magic, god, the simulation or just bleeding edge physics as the whole field is getting weirder and weirder. The whole notion of natures beauty stemming from some replicable, controllable and "no magic" scenario is a very "homo sapiens" desire for order and control. We know close to nothing, and therein lies the beauty in my eyes.

- resilience

He offered a framework for that agenda, characterized by three approaches: resilience, “what are the valued norms and behaviours that human societies will wish to maintain as they seek to survive?”; relinquishment, “letting go of certain assets, behaviors and beliefs, where retaining them could make matters worse”; and restoration, “rediscovering attitudes and approaches to life and organization that our hydrocarbon-fuelled civilization eroded.”

- plundered from [Sam Kriss](https://samkriss.substack.com/)

> All things, Apethitikes says, are born from bitterness. It is in their nature to be hostile. At the beginning of time, there was only an infinitely small spark, which flared into being because of its hatred of the void. Once it had sparked, it had nothing to hate but itself; recoiling away from its own being, it broke into millions of mutually loathing atoms, which is why there are distinct objects today. Time exists because each instant hates each other instant and insists on being separated from it. The Sun smears itself across the sky because it hates every position it occupies, and light bursts out from its surface in explosive horror. The Moon has its phases because it hates both darkness and light. Rains fall because they hate the heavens. Plants grow upwards because they hate the earth. Everything is constantly in tension and contradiction, and this poisonous churn is what we call life. A world without hatred would be sterile, motionless, and empty. Insipid oneness. A placid speck. Apethitikes of Ephesus loved hatred, and he loved the world hatred had built. To sit peacefully in the afternoon and watch the birds wheeling above the bright blue sea. This million-petalled flower; this treasury of things.

> God brought humanity into a life of suffering solely to punish us for being lesser than him, and that all souls eventually make their way to Hell

> God may again allow some mote of his goodness to fall upon this wicked world, so by the contrast we might better see it for the filthy sewer it is?

> Sometimes, he writes, ‘a terrible thought arises: that God did not build this world to punish us, nor as a gift for us, but that he has a purpose for this great contraption that is entirely his own, and pays us no mind at all.’

- plundered from François Rabelais

Ist es denn Unrecht, wenn ich für euch erglühte?  
Und Schmach, wenn ich in Eures Leibes Pracht,  
Die Samt und Seide neidisch überdacht,  
Gedankenvoll mit meinen Wünschen wüte?  
Verstattet diesem hitzigen Geblüte,  
Daß es an Euer Liebespförtchen poch!  
Dann seufzt ihr wohl:  
"Wie, werter Freund, schon müde?  
Nur einmal noch!"

- plundered from [Sam Kriss](https://samkriss.substack.com/)

> the bardo the two peasants had found themselves in was the sidpa bardo, the bardo of becoming, the one we experience after death. Sidpa bardo is tahe interzone between one life and the next, the junkyard of earthly existence, packed with the detritus and runoff of worlds. This is where gods and buddhas take on their fearsome forms, and to pass through sidpa bardo involves suffering many frightening visions. Because this bardo state is made of unstructured waste-thought leaking out from all other bardos, it is always flickering, impermanent. You will see a world you do not understand, and you will see it in ruins. Every city you pass through is bombed. Every person you meet falls dead in battle. You will be attacked by demons and wild animals. But sidpa bardo is educative; the point of these visions is to prepare you for being born again. The entire Second World War had been fought solely to teach these two Tibetan peasants some secret for their next life. They believed they had learned that secret. They had no interest in returning to Gyêgumdo. They did not want the war to have been in vain.

Tech is the funniest industry and it always will be. It's a bunch of people who think they are creatures of pure logic, but every problem they try to solve turns out to be a human problem that is inherently illogical. The results are endlessly hysterical.

- (i think) plundered from [Blood Rites](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30842898-blood-rites)

[...] if we concede to war at least some measure of the automony enjoyed by living things, then we must acknowledge that we have invested these lofty passions in a peculiar kind of god indeed - an entity that is ultimately alien to us and supremely indifferent to our fate. We have sacrificed our loved ones for what is worse than nothing: we have sacrificed them for something that has no use to us.

---

art may, and should, be produced by anyone who wants to; and it may, and should, be enjoyed by anyone who willingly partakes of it. If one accepts those precepts, then it stands to reason that the imagination must not be subject to any culturally imposed purity tests.

- (i think) plundered from [sun eye moon eye](https://goodreads.com/book/show/201966803-sun-eye-moon-eye)

God whose one eye is the Moon and the other, the Sun. Vision blending somewhere at the back of the skull. The moon eye saw in grainy black and white, the sun eye in color, with clarity. The moon eye was at home in a netherworld where only the shadow of the ordinary fell. The sun eye followed every line and angle, every contour, was fascinated by shape’s lovely demise—a melting candle, say.
