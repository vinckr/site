Hi, I'm Vincent, welcome to my digital garden.  
I am **Developer Advocate** and **Head of Community at Ory** where my team helps developers build secure and open source identity infrastructure for the web.

I'm an Ory contributor and help lead our open-source communities, focusing on documentation, support, and developer content.
My passions include, but are not limited to frontend development, generative art, electronic music, liminal spaces and communities.

</br>

Need help with a website or building a community around an open source project? Feel free to [contact me](mailto:mail@vinckr.com).
