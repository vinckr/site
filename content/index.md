My name is Vincent - I am in charge of **Developer Relations** at [**Ory**](https://www.ory.com/). Ory helps developers build secure, scalable, and open-source auth for the web. I'm also a contributor and maintainer of the open-source [Ory project](https://github.com/ory).

My other passion is mixing music as a DJ - [read more about it here](./music).
I also enjoy reading, writing, practical philosophy, and symbiotic relationships with hive-minded arthropods 🐝

This my personal website. There are a lot like it, but this one is mine.  
It's my virtual garden, testlab, and archive. Don't take it too seriously!

I believe in the power and merit of open and free information and try to advance this cause wherever possible.
