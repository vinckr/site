My name is Vincent - I serve as **Head of Community** and **Developer Advocate at Ory**. My team and I support developers build safe and open identity systems for the web.

I'm a contributor and maintainer of the Ory [open-source community](https://github.com/ory), focusing on documentation, developer advocacy, and educational content.

If you need help with a website or developing a community around an open-source project, please feel free to [contact me](mailto:mail@vinckr.com).
