My name is Vincent - I am in charge of **Developer Relations** at **Ory**. My team and I help developers build secure and open identity systems for the web.

I'm a contributor and maintainer of the [Ory open-source community](https://github.com/ory). My responsibilities include community growth, documentation, developer advocacy, and content among others.

Launching a new community, building a developer ecosystem, or growing an open-source project can be challenging. Let me help you create a developer relations program that will set you up for long-term success. [Contact me](mailto:mail@vinckr.com) for a free consultation.
