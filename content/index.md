Hi, I'm Vincent.  
I'm a **Developer Advocate at Ory** where my team helps developers build secure and open source identity infrastructure for the web.

I'm an Ory contributor and help lead our open-source communities, focusing on documentation, education, and good developer content.

Need help with a website or building a community around an open source project? Feel free to [contact me](mailto:mail@vinckr.com).
