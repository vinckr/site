Hi, I'm Vincent.  
I'm **Head of Community** and **Developer Advocate at Ory** where my team helps developers build secure and open identity infrastructure for the web.

I'm a contributor and leader of the Ory [open-source community](https://github.com/ory), focusing on documentation, advocacy, and educational content.

Need help with a website or building a community around an open source project? Feel free to [contact me](mailto:mail@vinckr.com).
