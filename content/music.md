Music is a big passion of mine. I enjoy a wide range of genres, from drum&bass, dubstep, to blues, jazz, metal to other electronic styles and hip hop beats. Whenever possible I buy music directly from the artist or via [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/turdbaby).

Under the name **Dubz** I am performing as a DJ, mixing music, and tinkering with beats.

> **Dubz** takes you on a colorful journey through all varieties of bass music, be it soulful garage, gritty dubstep, uptempo kuduro, brostep, or almighty jungle; an eclectic mix of everything that can lead to the fringes of breakcore and dark dub - anything goes, as long as your feet move, the sweat is dripping from the ceiling, and the rave is in ruins afterwards!

My older pseudonyms include _Turdbaby_, _Dubzlinger_, and _Miskatonic_.  
You can find some of my old tracks on [soundcloud.com/dubz-you](https://soundcloud.com/dubz-you) and a list of my mixes on [mixcloud.com/dubz_you](https://www.mixcloud.com/dubz_you/) (or listen to them in the widget below).  
Being a part of [_Eisbach Callin_](https://eisbachcallin.com/) - the longest running bass music party in Munich - has been a huge positive force in my life since 2009.

I love sharing music!
