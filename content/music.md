Music is a big passion of mine. I enjoy a wide range of genres, from blues, jazz, metal to electronic music and hip hop beats. Whenever possible I buy music directly from the artist or via Bandcamp.

Under the name _Turdbaby_ I am live mixing music and tinkering with beats. You can find some of my old material on [soundcloud.com/turdbaby](https://soundcloud.com/turdbaby) and a list of my mixes on [mixcloud.com/turdbaby](https://www.mixcloud.com/turdbaby/) (or listen to them in the widget below).
Being a part of [_Eisbach Callin_](https://eisbachcallin.com/), the longest running bass music party in Munich, has been a huge positive force in my life for more than 13 years.

I love sharing music!

> Turdbaby takes you on a colorful journey through all varieties of bass music, be it soulful garage, gritty dubstep, uptempo kuduro, brostep, or almighty jungle; an eclectic mix of everything that can lead to the fringes of breakcore and dark dub - anything goes, as long as the rave is in ruins afterwards!
