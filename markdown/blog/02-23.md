# Log February 2023

Hello friend. The log is a collection of links I come across in a given month and thought would be worth for you to check out. This month I am trying out something new and writing a small preface or introduction. There is not real theme or topic to this, just a loose collection of thoughts on the past month. I have been keeping journals for some time, but was always very inconsistent with them. In some days I would write many entries and then forget about it until a year later. I always found it hard to motivate myself to write a journal. A big part of that is that it seemed kind of silly or self-centered; but in hindsight I believe it is a healthy thing to do. I want to be as honest and open as possible in this public log; but I won't let the truth stand in the way of a good story. Make of that what you will, but don't assume anything written here as fact.  
It is kind of ironic that I am starting to publish more long-form texts, just when the "AI" godhead could spew up much better material in seconds. But someone needs to produce the training material, even if my drivel would make for poor training. In any case there have been no stochastic parrots harmed in the making of my logs, and won't be in the future.  
I don't aim to make this a profound source of knowledge, or even impress, flatter, or amuse you. It is purely for my own arrogant pleasure, knowing that I can inflict my thoughts on the world; a perverse amusement that I am fully in control in this realm, for better or worse.  
Anyway, what a strange and wonderful month it has been. I don't have anything interesting to say, just that I am looking forward to what is coming next and maybe I can get my ass up and finish some of the other content I have lying around half-done.

Anway, enjoy this months links and I hope we'll see each other again next month!

PS: I also want to change the style and layout of the website a bit and maybe even migrate tech stack. We will see how that went in the next one - sometimes helps to put a bit of pressure on myself in this way.
