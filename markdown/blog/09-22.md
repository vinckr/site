# Log September 2022

_Last updated on 12.11.2022_

Using a slightly different template for this log. The log is a bit late, but the links are still interesting and relevant. I also added a section for `Imagen`, this section contains links on generative "AI" art. I am planning to do a more detailed writeup of my adventures with StableDiffusion containing all the links and some guides how to do stuff - a lot of my free time in the last months was spent with StableDiffusion. Enjoy.
