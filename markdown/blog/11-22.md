- [Luminette: Light therapy glasses](https://www.myluminette.com/uk)
  - I considered using these glasses that blast you with light as a way to combat winter blues, but it seems they are not very effective. Instead, I try to get natural sunlight whenever possible. Even in the winter, it is usually possible to get at least an hour of sunlight on your skin every day. IMO natural light is a more effective way to improve your mood and combat winter blues.
