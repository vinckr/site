# Random cheatsheet

_Last updated on 26.06.2022_

A mixed collection of commands I had to look up at some point and collect here for future reference. 
Probably not useful at all for anyone else but me ;-)

### Mixed/UNIX

Show all active ports: `sudo lsof -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN -n -P`  
Kill process for that port:`sudo kill -9 <PID>`  
DNS Lookup: `dig WWW.VINCKR.COM +nostats +nocomments +nocmd`

## CSS

Child selector selects all elements that are the children of a specified element ([See also](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_combinators.asp))  
`div > p`

<img class="center" src="./img/hero-git.png" alt="A decorative image" />
