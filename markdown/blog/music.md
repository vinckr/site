# hello friend ðŸ”Š

Music has always been a big passion of mine. I enjoy a wide range of genres, from blues, jazz, and metal to electronic and hip hop beats, as well as the eclectic, genre-defying music produced by artists around the world.

Under the name _Turdbaby_ I have been DJing and tinkering with beats and waveforms since 2009, using software like [Ableton](https://www.ableton.com/) and [Reaper](https://www.reaper.fm/), as well as various analog and digital devices. You can find some of my old material on [soundcloud.com/turdbaby](https://soundcloud.com/turdbaby) and a list of my mixes on [mixcloud.com/turdbaby](https://www.mixcloud.com/turdbaby/) (or listen to them in the widget below).

**If you would like me to play at your event or party, please send me [an email](mailto:mail+dj@vinckr.com) with details. My rates are flexible and can be adjusted to fit your budget.It is essential to have a subwoofer and proper PA system for my bass-heavy music. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.**

Even though I have not turned music production into a job, I still have a passion for DJing and producing music in my free time. Founding and being a part of [_Eisbach Callin_](https://eisbachcallin.com/), the longest running underground drum and bass and bass music party in Munich, has been a huge positive force in my life for over 13 years.

I love sharing music!

Check out my boilerplate press release:

> Turdbaby takes you on a colorful journey through all varieties of bass music, be it soulful garage, gritty dubstep, uptempo kuduro, brostep, or almighty jungle; simply an eclectic mix of everything that can lead to the fringes of breakcore and dark dub - anything goes, as long as the rave is in ruins afterwards!
