# hello stranger &#128075;

Welcome to my personal website. There are many like it but this one is
mine.

It is my virtual garden, testlab, and archive for thoughts and
useful resources. Here you can read about topics that interest me, check
out interesting links, or some of the other pages. I am passionate about
philosophy, open source software, music, literature, liminal spaces and
communities.  
If you are interested in what I am doing professionally or
you want help with building a community your open source project, please
feel free to write me, contact below.  
I think everyone should have their personal space online outside the control of big social media giants,
furthering the creativity and diversity online.
I believe in the power and merit of an open and free internet and try to advance this cause where I can.
