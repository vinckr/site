# hello stranger &#128075;

Welcome to my personal website. There are many like it but this one is
mine. It is my virtual garden, testlab, and archive. Read about
topics that interest me, check out [links](./links.html), or some of the
other pages. I am interested in philosophy, open source software, music,
literature, liminal spaces and communities.

Would you like your own personal website or need help with building a community
or open source project? Feel free to [write me](mailto:mail@vinckr.com).
Everyone should have a personal space online, furthering creativity and diversity.

I believe in the power and merit of an open and free internet and try to advance this cause where I can.
