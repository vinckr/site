    My name is Vincent and this is my personal corner of the internet. There are many like it but this one is mine.
  </p>
  <p>
    I spent time doing electrical engineering, but am more interested in the soft<small>(ware)</small> side of computers.
    I have experience in several fields including - among others - developer relations, community management, on/offline event production, translation (DE/ENG), support, lighting tech, and music production.
    <p>Today I work at <a href="https://ory.sh/">Ory</a> - building resilient open source communities.</p>

    Feel free to <a href="./contact.html">contact me</a>, if you have a request or question or need help with your open source community. Have a look around, I have an old-timey <a href="./links.html">link collection</a> and write in my <a href="./blog.html" >journal</a>.
