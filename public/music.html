    <h1>hello friend ðŸ”Š</h1>

<p>Music has always been a big passion of mine. I enjoy a wide range of genres, from blues, jazz, and metal to electronic and hip hop beats, as well as the eclectic, genre-defying music produced by artists around the world.</p>

<p>Under the name <em>Turdbaby</em> I have been DJing and tinkering with beats and waveforms using software like <a href="https://www.ableton.com/">Ableton</a> and <a href="https://www.reaper.fm/">Reaper</a>, as well as various analog and digital devices, since 2009. You can find some of my old material on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/turdbaby">soundcloud.com/turdbaby</a> and a list of my mixes on <a href="https://www.mixcloud.com/turdbaby/">mixcloud.com/turdbaby</a> (or listen to them in the widget below).</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>If you would like me to play at your event or party, please send me <a href="mailto:mail+dj@vinckr.com">an email</a> with details. My rates are flexible and can be adjusted to fit your budget.It is essential to have a subwoofer and proper PA system for my bass-heavy music. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>Even though I have not turned music production into a job, I still have a passion for DJing and producing music in my free time. Founding and being a part of <a href="https://eisbachcallin.com/"><em>Eisbach Callin</em></a>, the longest running underground drum and bass and bass music party in Munich, has been a huge positive force in my life for over 13 years.</p>

<p>I love sharing music!</p>

<p>Check out my boilerplate press release:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Turdbaby takes you on a colorful journey through all varieties of bass music, be it soulful garage, gritty dubstep, uptempo kuduro, brostep, or almighty jungle; simply an eclectic mix of everything that can lead to the fringes of breakcore and dark dub - anything goes, as long as the rave is in ruins afterwards!</p>
