shortlog april 2022

- A [Ory Keto](https://github.com/ory/keto/)/Zanzibar-like [authorization system from Airbnb](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/himeji-a-scalable-centralized-system-for-authorization-at-airbnb-341664924574).
- Watched [Moonfall](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5834426/), read my review [here](../reviews).
- Read "[Hollow](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56212878-hollow)" by Brian Catlin. First impression:
  A band of criminals violent criminals escort a mysterious bone-eating oracle to the tower of Babel through a medieval wasteland right out of a Bosch painting. Would recommend.
