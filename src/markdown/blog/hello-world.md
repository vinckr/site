Hello world.

I started many blogs and most of those died after a few posts.  
Lets hope I can keep this one going longer. It is on my own domain and of my own design so that much is a improvement over the various other platforms I used before. It also means some work to maintain and style it, but I think its worth it.

It feels weird blogging or writing about technical topics and reviewing movies and spinning my little theories on fictional worlds when there is so much turmoil happening all around us. In a world of platforms and silos there is no escape and no quiet.  
For just this reason focusing on constructive or creative efforts in my own domain helps me stay grounded.
This blog and website are my garden and I can tend do it and grow and nurture it or just sit in the shade and relax a bit.  
This is my garden, look upon my works ye mighty and despair.
