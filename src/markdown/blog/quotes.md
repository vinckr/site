Some quotes I want to share.  
Not all of these are to be taken serious. I don't fully endorse, believe in, or live by the content of each quote (but some of them), I just find them worth to collect and share. Some are statements made by famous people, others I found in random places on the internet. (Attribution added where I am certain.)

>"The evolution of the idea of money is closely associated, for reasons which must be apparent to even the most casual observer, with the development of the notions of sin and guilt. Even in the earliest periods of trade we find rudimentary principles at work such as would lead us to believe that primitive man had evolved methods of exchange which sui generis implied the existence of debt. It was not until Ricardo’s time, however, that a formula was arrived at which expressed the relationship between debtor and creditor beyond all caviling. With almost Euclidian simplicity Ricardo summed it up thus: "a debt is discharged by the delivery of money." The realization that we collectively have no idea what we're doing here, that a whole lot of what we believe to be real and permanent is imaginary and temporary, and that there are no rules to life, no winners, that we should take care of nature and each other, and that you should follow your muse to do what you find interesting and beautiful." - [Henry Miller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Miller)

>"You will be fooled by a trick if it involves more time, money and practice than you (or any other sane onlooker) would be willing to invest."

>"Although the bag on the oxygen mask may not inflate, oxygen is flowing."
