I sometimes review and rate media I consume.

### ðŸŽž movies

#### [Moonfall](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5834426/): 3

<details><summary markdown="span">âžœ click for full Moonfall review.</summary>

If you enjoy apocalyptic movies (uh, like most other Emmerich movies) and conspiracy theories I can recommend it.
I love everything about the moon so I had to watch this. This movie is so full of tropes it made it hard to watch at times.
Some convoluted family relations and characters I did not care to follow, but John Bradley saved it for me.
We learn that anyone can fly and operate a space shuttle under any conditions with some helpful comments by a pro.
Watch it for the destruction and great visuals - the rest is a bit meh. People who care about realism in science fiction will probably get very mad watching this.

should have been on the soundtrack: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9MZNEXrElw

#### [Spiderman: No Way Home](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10872600/): 3

<details><summary markdown="span">âžœ click for full Spiderman review.</summary>

Overall it was entertaining, everything looked very much like CGI. When Willem Dafoe first appeared I thought they completely animated him, same with Tobey Maguire. Not sure if this was intended effect, but they looked like using a bad bluescreen. The superhero effects were good otherwise, but the faces had this uncanny valley feeling to them.
The story is based on an interesting concept on multiverses and it was my first contact with how the DC(?) universe handles these different time and storylines.I love about the multiverse that you can imagine all kinds of stories and it is still all in contained in a "consistent" universe.  
All in all i don't regret seeing the movie, but you also have not missed much if you don't see it.

### ðŸ“– books

#### [Der Bau/The Burrow](<https://de.m.wikisource.org/wiki/Der_Bau_(Kafka)>): 5

<details><summary markdown="span">âžœ click for full Der Bau review.</summary>

Read this. Like most Kafka stories it is short. The story is centered around the paranoid protagonist describing life in his burrow and the measures he(?) takes to secure it from his enemies. For example the protagonist is trying to decide if he should keep an entrance so he can escape in emergencies. But then the escape hatch could be used by the enemy to invade the burrow. It seems this is a problem that can't be solved and only the beginning of the protagonists paranoia.  
In my mind the protagonist is a badger, it seemed to fit the story as I imagined it.
